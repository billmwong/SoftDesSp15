With the original settings, I couldn't get the distance any lower than 2 after 500 generations.  I increased the probability of mutation to 0.3, which made it solve the message within 500 generations.  I decided to increase the probability of mutation all the way up to 0.9, and it solved it much faster.  However, if I increase the probability of crossover to 0.9, it doesn't get below a distance of 3.
